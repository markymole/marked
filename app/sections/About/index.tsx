          I got into web development back in college and scored myself a
          Bachelor&apos;s in it. Funny thing is, I didn&apos;t know squat about
          coding at first, but I stuck with it. Turns out, not only did I pick
          up the language, but I also fell head over heels for it. <br />
          <br /> While I was hitting the books, I lucked out with some projects
          from friends and contacts. That hands-on stuff? Best teacher ever.
          Outside of classes, you&apos;ll catch me either gaming or tinkering
          with my own projects â€“ gotta keep those skills sharp, you know? <br />
          <br /> Now, I&apos;m doing the Web Wizard thing at Fullstack HQ.
          It&apos;s a mix of projects with all sorts of tech. Every job throws
          different tools and tricks my way, and I&apos;m soaking it all in.
          That&apos;s how I&apos;ve been growing as a web developer.
